## Pure Revisited

### Example: Tor-torsion Theory

A tor-torsion theory induces a cotorsion theory with good proeprty.

{% def %}
Say $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$ consists of a tor-torsion theory, provided

$$\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}^⊺ := \ker \mathrm{Tor}(\mathcal{A}, -) = \mathcal{B}; \quad {}^⊺\mathcal{B} := \ker \mathrm{Tor}(-, \mathcal{B}) = \mathcal{A}.
\end{equation}$$

{% enddef %}

{% pro %}
Show that both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are closed under summands, extensions, and filtered colimits.

- In general, the left derives of the left adjoint commutes with filtered colimits.

{% endpro %}

The following lemma ***embeds*** the tor-torsion theory into general cotorsion theory.

{% lem %}
For any $X ∈ 𝐌𝐨𝐝 _R$ and $Y ∈ 𝐌𝐨𝐝 _{R^{\mathrm{op}}}$, $\mathrm{Ext}^1(X,Y^+) =0$ **iff** $\mathrm{Tor}_1(X,Y) = 0$.

{% pf %}
Note that $(-)^+$ preserves and reflects exactness and zero-objects.

$$\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Ext}^1(X, Y^+) = H^1((P(X), Y^+)) ≃ (H^1(P(X) ⊗ Y))^+ = \mathrm{Tor}_1(X, Y)^+.
\end{equation}$$
{% endpf %}

{% endlem %}

{% thm %}
A tor-torsion theory $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$ induces a cotorsion theory $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{A}^⟂ )$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under filtered limits.

{% pf %}
Note that $\mathcal{A} = {}^⟂ (\mathcal{B}^+) = {}^⊺\mathcal{B}$.
{% endpf %}

{% endthm %}

{% ex %}
$(𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 , \mathcal{A})$ and $(\mathcal{A}, 𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 )$ are tor-torsion theories. Hence $(𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 , 𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 ^⟂ )$ is a cotorsion theory. $𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 ^⟂$ is known as *Enoch's cotorsion module*.

$$\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}^+ ⊆ \text{Pure Injective} ⊆ 𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 ^⟂.
\end{equation}$$

Note that $𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 = ^⟂ (\mathcal{A}^+) = ^⟂ (\text{Pure Injective}) = ^⟂ (𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 ^⟂)$.

{% endex %}

{% ex %}
(Torsion-free module). Recall that

$$\begin{equation}
0 → \mathrm{Tor}_1(X, R/(r)) → X ⊗ (r) → X → X ⊗ R/(r) → 0.
\end{equation}$$

If $R$ has no zero-divisor, then $\mathrm{Tor}_1(X, R/(r)) = \{xr = 0 ∣ x ∈ X\}$ is a subgroup. If $R$ is commutative domain with factional field $K$, then

$$\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Tor}_1(X,K/R) = \varinjlim_{r ∈ R ∖ \{0\}} \! \!\! ^{fil} \ \ \mathrm{Tor}(X,R/(r)) = \text{torsion subgrp of } \ X.
\end{equation}$$

A torsion-free tor-torsion theory (for general rings) is cogenerated by cyclic modules, i.e.,

$$\begin{equation}
𝐓𝐅 = {}^⊺ 𝐂𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐜 = {}^⟂ \{(R/(r))^+ : r ∈ R\}.
\end{equation}$$

### Pure World

We revisit some pure-related concepts.

{% thm %}
(Pure $\mathrm{Ext}^1$). The pure extension group $\mathrm{Ext}_p^1$ is a well-defined additive subbifunctor of $\mathrm{Ext}^1$.

{% pf %}
Firstly split ses are pure. Recall that

1. pure embeddings are stable under pushout of ses, since the pushout of pure embeddings is pure;
2. pure embeddings are stable under pullback of ses, since $gf$ is a pure embedding only $f$ is a pure embedding.

Pure ses are closed under sum and summands of ses. Hence the operation of Yoneda groups is well-defined.

{% endpf %}

{% endthm %}

{% thm %}
(Pure orthogonality). Recall that

1. $\mathrm{Ext}_p^1(X,-) = \mathrm{Ext}^1(X,-)$ iff $X$ is flat;
    - Flat = filtered colimit of projectives.
2. $\mathrm{Ext}_p^1(-,Y) = \mathrm{Ext}^1(-,Y)$ iff $Y$ is FP-injective;
    - FP-injective = $(𝐦𝐨𝐝)^⟂ = 𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐒𝐮𝐛 (𝐈𝐧𝐣)$.
3. $\mathrm{Ext}_p^1(X,-) = 0$ iff $X$ is pure projective;
    - Pure projective = $𝐒𝐦𝐝 (∐ (𝐦𝐨𝐝))$.
4. $\mathrm{Ext}_p^1(-,Y) = 0$ iff $Y$ is pure injective.
    - Pure injective $⊇ \operatorname{im}((-)^+)$.

{% endthm %}

{% thm %}
Pure-projective cover may not exists.

{% pf %}
We show a narrow proof. Note that projective covers are stable under summands and coproducts.
{% endpf %}
