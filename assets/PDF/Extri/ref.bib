  abstract = {We survey the basics of homological algebra in exact categories in the sense of Quillen. All diagram lemmas are proved directly from the axioms, notably the five lemma, the 3{\texttimes}3-lemma and the snake lemma. We briefly discuss exact functors, idempotent completion and weak idempotent completeness. We then show that it is possible to construct the derived category of an exact category without any embedding into abelian categories and we sketch Deligne's approach to derived functors. The construction of classical derived functors with values in an abelian category painlessly translates to exact categories, i.e., we give proofs of the comparison theorem for projective resolutions and the horseshoe lemma. After discussing some examples we elaborate on Thomason's proof of the Gabriel--Quillen embedding theorem in an appendix.},

In recent years representation theory has been an area of intense research and the author shows that derived categories of finite-dimensional algebras are a useful tool in studying tilting processes. Results on the structure of derived categories of hereditary algebras are used to investigate Dynkin algebras and interated tilted algebras. The author shows how triangulated categories arise naturally in the study of Frobenius categories. The study of trivial extension algebras and repetitive algebras is then developed using the triangulated structure on the stable category of the algebra's module category. With a comprehensive reference section, algebraists and research students in this field will find this an indispensable account of the theory of finite-dimensional algebras.},
