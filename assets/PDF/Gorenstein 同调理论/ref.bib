  abstract = {Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu as a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. A notion of proper class in an extriangulated category is defined in this paper. Let C be an extriangulated category and {$\xi$} a proper class in C. We prove that C admits a new extriangulated structure. This construction gives extriangulated categories which are neither exact categories nor triangulated categories. Moreover, we introduce and study {$\xi$}-Gorenstein projective objects in C and demonstrate that {$\xi$}-Gorenstein projective objects share some basic properties with Gorenstein projective objects in module categories or in triangulated categories. In particular, we refine a result of Asadollahi and Salarian (2004) [1]. As an application, the admissible model structure on extriangulated categories is obtained.},
