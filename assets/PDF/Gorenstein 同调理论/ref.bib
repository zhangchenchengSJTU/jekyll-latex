  abstract = {Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu as a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. A notion of proper class in an extriangulated category is defined in this paper. Let C be an extriangulated category and {$\xi$} a proper class in C. We prove that C admits a new extriangulated structure. This construction gives extriangulated categories which are neither exact categories nor triangulated categories. Moreover, we introduce and study {$\xi$}-Gorenstein projective objects in C and demonstrate that {$\xi$}-Gorenstein projective objects share some basic properties with Gorenstein projective objects in module categories or in triangulated categories. In particular, we refine a result of Asadollahi and Salarian (2004) [1]. As an application, the admissible model structure on extriangulated categories is obtained.},

    abstract = { Let ( C, E, s ) be an extriangulated category with a proper class ξ of E -triangles. We study complete cohomology of objects in ( C, E, s ) by applying ξ-projective resolutions and ξ-injective coresolutions constructed in ( C, E, s ) . Vanishing of complete cohomology detects objects with finite ξ-projective dimension and finite ξ-injective dimension. As a consequence, we obtain some criteria for the validity of the Wakamatsu tilting conjecture and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a virtually Gorenstein algebra to be Gorenstein. Moreover, we give a general technique for computing complete cohomology of objects with finite ξ - G projective dimension. As an application, the relations between ξ -projective dimension and ξ - G projective dimension for objects in ( C, E, s ) are given. }
